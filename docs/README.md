### Spotify's genres of the future
Spotify has several curious genres within its database, including some which are charactized by the word *future*, namely the following 5:
- futurepop
- future funk
- kawaii future bass
- future ambient
- future garage
On first sight, these genres seem to be related at least somewhat. For example, the artist *Snail's House* is listed as both an future funk and a kawaii future bass artist. The other genres seem to fall in other categories however. Where future funk and kawaii future bass are generally more typical music, the others fall more on the side of experimental music. The Spotify API reports large differences in statistics between the genres, especially in terms of energy and danceability.

It is definitely not clear if these genres are connected by something more than just their name. I want to explore why these genres are called the way the are, and if a (strong) connection might actually tie these genres together.
